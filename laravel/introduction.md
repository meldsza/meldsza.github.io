# Welcome to the laravel blog
I started to learn laravel on the recommendation of a friend and found it to be great. The loadlash style functions and ease of use is what makes this MVC frameworks one of the best MVC frameworks in the world. It has redesigned my outlook on php which i once thought as confusing and not worth my time. 

Like they say, the best way to learn is to be pratical with it and hence my journey with laravel began. On the way i learned many tricks on how to customise laravel to work according to your needs. I found [Eloquents](https://laravel.com/docs/5.4/eloquent) to be amazing as i could link multiple eloquents to organise data like never before. Using eloquents also means that i reduce the risk of getting sql injections which is thought to be the most dangerous pothole to leave behind in any php code
